# System Architektur von Oranio AI

Oranio AI is based on a flexible architecture that combines Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain technology. It consists of the following main components:

1. **Token Creation on Solana**:
This component interacts directly with the Solana blockchain to create and deploy new tokens. It allows the blockchain to be used as a distributed ledger for crypto assets.

2. **Chemical Simulation:**
A simple chemical simulation is used to influence digital assets and optimize token values based on specific reactions.

3. **AI Models for Optimization:**
AI models are trained to optimize digital assets based on historical data and market trends.

4. **API and Web Interaction:**
The system can be accessed via an API to manage Solana interactions, train models, and perform chemical simulations..
